This is a thai board game made in plain Javascript.

Rules are to bring down all the tiles on the board.

You role two dices at once. If you get for instance
5 and 3.
It means you bring down tile number 5, 3 or combined (8).

If you get 5 and 3 but tile number 5, 3 and 8 are already brought down but there are still tiles on thr board, you'll loose.
